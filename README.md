## Welcome to the code for my personal website!
_The Technical Details_

I like to consider myself an efficient puritan. I love using my own CSS for unique styling, and building websites from scratch. I also love to create mobile-responsive websites very quickly. So this website is built with a slight (but important) reliance on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/ "You already know it!").

I also used ParticleJS and AnimeJS (CSS files downloaded via NodeJS) in a limited capacity, just to add an element of fun (and infuse my personality into the website), while also balancing the needs of mobile devices.

_My Design Process_

Creating a portfolio requires you to create a brand identity for yourself. As a financier-turned-developer (I've always been a creative), I really wanted to this collection of pages to truly represent my path. So I chose what's possibly the most common recurring colour in the brand packages for all financial services companies: blue. Blue is somehow the universal favourite in finance, especially for data-driven presentations. But it's also a versatile colour, and in the larger sense, it conveys a sense of calm (in the lightest form, a sunny day, and in the darkest, the deep lull of the night) and collectedness. I guess that's why it has become an indicator of trustworthiness and reliability. This would be the backdrop for my identity: a nod to my background and what I take from it.  

I created a very minimalist portfolio with a high contrast colour scheme using my favourite colour to add just a little bit of pop - orange. Orange is just a high energy colour, one that represents rejuvenation and refreshment. I wanted to juxtapose my serious side with the fun, create aspects of my abilities, and remind people that I am constantly looking to "freshen up" my repertoire of skills. I used variations of orange across the website, perhaps most importantly in my logo. Of course my logo would be the colour I used to represent change and dynamics and fun across my whole porfolio: this is perhaps the most important aspect of what I strive to be. If I chose one aspect of my personality to define me, it would be my constant yearning for self-improvement and learning (I guess that explains the choice of a technical field, eh?). So it was fitting to use a fluid, script 'n' on the orange circle.
