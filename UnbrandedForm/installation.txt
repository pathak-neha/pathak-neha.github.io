Installation of the Unbranded version:

METHOD 1 (Automatted)

Upload all files to your website.
In your browser, open the file freecontactforminstall.php and install.




METHOD 2 (Manual)

Create the file 'freecontactformsettings.php' using a code/plain text Editor.

Insert the following code into this file :-

<?php

$email_to = "youremailaddress@yourdomain.com"; // your email address
$email_subject = "Contact Form Message"; // email subject line
$thankyou = "thankyou.htm"; // thank you page

// if you update the question on the form -
// you need to update the questions answer below
$antispam_answer = "25";


// If you have problems receiving emails, 
// change the option below:
// OPTIONS: "default", "sendmail" or "smtp"
$emailing_option = "default";

// if you are using "smtp" add the details here
$smtp_host = "smtp.mandrillapp.com";
$smtp_port = "587";
$smtp_user = "";
$smtp_pass = "";
?>

Enter your email address in place of youremailaddress@yourdomain.com

Change the email subject (if you like)

Change your thank you page reference (if you like)

Save the file.


Copy ALL files onto your website using an FTP program (filezilla for example)

Note: If you're using $emailing_option = "default", then you do NOT need to
upload the "lib" folder. This is only needed if you're using "sendmail" or "smtp".
